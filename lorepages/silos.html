<h2>On Silos</h2>
<p>Before the <em>First Crush</em> the <em>Twelve Silos of Overrun</em> were equal parts testament and treatise.
	Testament, to the progress of Dwarvenâ€”and thereby mortal, ambition. Treatise, between the previously unaligned
	mortal forces. It was the illusion of peace. It was not to last.
</p>

<h2>Stronghold</h2>
<p>Disarming a Silo is no simple task. They were said to have been strongholds rivaling even the <em>Gates of
		Heaven</em>, capable of repelling the strongest beasts of <em>Overrun</em>. Chief among these defensive
	capabilities were so-called <em>Wardens:</em> elite clusters of warriors with formidable strength and
	<em>uncanny</em>
	techniques. It is believed that they answered directly to the <em>Baroness Shy</em> of their respective Silos.

<h2>Salvagable Ruin</h2>
<p>Through immense effort and over hundreds of years, nine Silos have been recovered. Five of them have been rebuilt
	anew,
	and constitute some of the largest cities in <em>Overrun</em>. Of them, the <em>Jeweled City of Banterok</em>,
	which
	sits atop the wreckage of Silo II is the most notable.</p>
<p>As of now, Silos VI, III, and I are still lost. Though there have been some rumours circulating as of late...</p>
