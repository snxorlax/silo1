<h2>Paradigm</h2>

<p>The glassy stone was discovered by <em>Sir Acorn Stew</em>, the famous gnomish archivist. It is said to have been the
	spark which ignited a new <em>Fire of Invention.</em> It was later reverse engineered, and is now easily
	reproduced. <em>Paradigm</em> was used to rebuild over three dozen cities over 300 years. It is used in larger
	structures from
	the <em>Towers of Squall</em>, to the <em>Brilliant Bridges</em>. It is occasionally used for smaller
	instruments as well, including vehicles and more rarely weapons.</p>
