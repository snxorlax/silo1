<h2>Banterok</h2>
<p>Otherwise known as the Jeweled City, Banterok was built upon the ruins of the <em>Second Silo.</em> Its name is
	derived from the material discovered during the excavation of that wreckage. Banterok is, without rival, the
	largest city in Overrun. Just as Silo II's fall marked the collapse of mortal resistance during the
	<em>Second Crush</em>, its reclamation has seen to the development of <em>various new wonders</em> integral to
	the expansion of the collective mortal will.

<p>Among the accolades, Banterok is also home to the <em>Council of Hammers,</em> the only known congregation of Dwarves
	remaining.</p>
