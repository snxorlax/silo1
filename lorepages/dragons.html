<p>Almost all that is known of dragons comes from the second volume of Durmester's Tome: <em>Paradox</em>. His writing
	seems to suggest that there was once a time when Dragons and mortalkind were on friendlier terms, suggesting
	that something changed some centuries ago. Much of the details have been lost to time, but what remains has been
	circulating in various translations, along with some other important pieces from the famous cartographer. Among
	the many revelations and important contributions to current understanding of Dragons comes from <em>On the
		Opposition of Reason,</em> the opening to the second volume:</p>

<p><em>"... what we see from them isn't generic cruelty, of which I am familiar. Instead, I observe an artistry there...
		Dragons reason in contradictions. Regardless of stature, class, age... from [hatchling] to the dreaded
		Task, their logicâ€”arcane, verbal, mechnical turn on a completely foreign axis. Our arcane
		forensics have uncovered only a depth of riddles. One must wonder, does this challenge the very basis of
		our abilities? Is our understanding woefully incomplete? Or perhaps they are simply mocking us, as they
		have been known to do." </em>
